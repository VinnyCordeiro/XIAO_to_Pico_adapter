# Seeeduino XIAO to Raspberry Pi Pico adapter for the ERCF Easy Board

This PCB is a simple adapter to use the Raspberry Pi Pico on the ERCF Easy Board instead of the originally used Seeeduino XIAO.

### Usage:

1. On the ERCF Easy Board you'll solder socket headers for the XIAO;
2. On the adapter board you solder pin headers on the bottom side of the board on the XIAO position, and socket headers on the Pico position (top or bottom, your choice)

After that it's just connecting everything together. The top silkscreen have the gpio pins used for Klipper configuration.
